The primary objective of SGN is to provide a social network unlike any other.  SGN is a combination of social network and forums such like reddit and facebook.  The SGN will let users create groups with their friends or with strangers and only in that group you will be able to see what they post.  If they are in another group in which you are not apart of and they post something under that group then that will not show under your feed.  For example, a group can users with the same interest such as “NBA” or “Music” .  Another example can be simply a group of friends that start a group between them.
